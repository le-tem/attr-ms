# Anthropogenic climate change amplifies risk of multiple sclerosis symptoms in Austria
Quantify the impact of climate change on the risk of core temperature rise that elicit Uhthoff's
(Temple et al., in prep)

## How to use this code
Code used for the analyisis is available in /main

The analysis is broken down into the following steps:
1. Climate data preparation: data extraction, bias correction
2. Climate attribution
3. Physiological modeling: core rise analysis, max met analysis
4. Visualisations and Results Tables

## Data availability
